'''
CSCI150 Fall 2019 Lab 8

Name: Caroline Cutter
Section: <B>

Creativity:
    - I added the file name in the title of the graph
    - I created a table using the data science table fucntion (I kept the old table too for requirments)
    - Prints out usage error if the wrong inputs are entered
    
    Sorry for the lack of creativity on this lab:( It was a very busy week!
