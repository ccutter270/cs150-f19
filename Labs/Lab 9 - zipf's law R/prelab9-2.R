Hi Mr. Linderman, Sorry this function doesnt work, I tried a bunch of different ways but I am just very unfimiliar with the different function
and syntax that this program uses. What I tried to do for this function is group the colum of Words so it would be each seperate word and then count them
but I could not figure out how to group them in R. Sorry I didnt come to office hours to try to fix this, it was a very busy week for me. If there is any
way that I could fix this or redo it, please let me know. Thanks!
